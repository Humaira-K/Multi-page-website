    <h3>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin, named for its historical crescent shape.
        Croissants and other viennoiserie are made of a layered yeast-leavened dough.

        Five fun facts:

<ul title="Facts about Croissants">
    <li>
        The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated in Austria in 1683. It was created in honor of the Austrian
        victory over the Turks and modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some historians say the croissant originated
        in Hungary)
    </li>
    <li>
        August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing the croissant to France when he opened his own
        Viennese bakery in Paris. (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to France...)
    </li>
    <li>
        The Croissant became the French national product in 1920.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich
        preferred a good brioche).
    </li>
    <li>
       Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or shell, not to eat on its own.
